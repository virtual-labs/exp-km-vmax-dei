### Procedure

<h3>Preparation of Reagents and Solutions</h3>
<h4>Phosphate Buffer (50 mM, pH 6.2):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Reagents: Sodium phosphate monobasic (NaH₂PO₄); Sodium phosphate dibasic (Na₂HPO₄);Distilled water</li>
    <li>Preparation: Dissolve 6.9 mM NaH₂PO₄ and 43.1 mM Na₂HPO₄ in distilled water. Adjust the pH to 6.2 using NaOH or HCl if needed. Make up the final volume to 100 mL and store at 4°C until use.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Substrate Solution (Micrococcus luteus Suspension, 0.2 mg/mL):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Reagents: Micrococcus luteus (lyophilized powder or fresh culture) Phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.2)
    </li>
    <li>Preparation: Suspend 0.2 mg of M. luteus powder in 1 mL of phosphate buffer. Vortex the solution to achieve a uniform suspension. Store on ice and mix well before use to prevent settling.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lysozyme Solution (0.1 mg/mL):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Reagents: Lysozyme (from egg white or recombinant source) Phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.2)</li>
    <li>Preparation: Dissolve 1 mg of lysozyme in 10 mL of phosphate buffer. Vortex gently to ensure complete dissolution. Store on ice or at 4°C if not used immediately.</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Experimental Setup</h3>
<h4>Reaction Setup</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Label test tubes for different substrate concentrations (e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 mg/mL M. luteus).</li>
    <li>Pipette 2.5 mL of substrate solution into each tube.</li>
    <li>Pre-warm the tubes in a 37°C water bath for 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Enzyme Reaction</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Add 0.1 mL of lysozyme solution to each tube.</li>
    <li>Mix well and record time (t = 0 min).</li>
    <li>Measure absorbance at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer every 30 seconds for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Record the decrease in absorbance over time, as lysozyme hydrolyzes bacterial cell walls.</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>Data Analysis and Determination of Km and Vmax</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Calculate Initial Reaction Velocity (V₀):</strong> 
        <li>Plot absorbance vs. time to determine the initial linear phase.</li>
        <li>The slope of this phase represents reaction velocity (V0).</li>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Plot Michaelis-Menten Curve:</strong>
        <li>Plot V0 against substrate concentration [S] to generate a hyperbolic curve.</li>
        <li>Identify Vmax (the plateau of the curve).</li>
        <li>Estimate Km as the substrate concentration at V0=Vmax/2.</li>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Use Lineweaver-Burk Plot:</strong> 
        <li>Lineweaver-Burk plot (double reciprocal plot) can also used to determine Km and Vmax more accurately.</li>
    </li>
</ul>
