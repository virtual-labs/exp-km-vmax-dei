### Aim
<p>The aim of this experiment is to estimate the enzymatic activity of lysozyme and determine its kinetic parameters, Km (Michaelis constant), and Vmax (maximum reaction velocity).</p>
<p> Lysozyme is an enzyme that hydrolyzes bacterial cell walls and follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. To characterize its activity, we will measure the initial reaction velocity (V₀) at varying substrate concentrations while keeping the enzyme concentration constant.</p>
<p>The collected data will be analyzed using enzyme kinetics models, such as the Lineweaver-Burk plot or nonlinear regression, to determine Km and Vmax. These parameters are crucial for understanding lysozyme’s catalytic efficiency, and substrate affinity. </p>
